## First, makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Then, cacheSolve computes the inverse of the special "matrix", if the inverse has already
## been calculated ante matrix has not changed, then the inverse is retrieved from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
